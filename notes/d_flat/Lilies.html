 Abstract 摘要</summary>
      <p>Lilies (short for "List Interpret Language in s-Expression Syntax") is a dialect of LISt-Processing language.</p>
    <p>This report describes the design and implementation of Lilies language.</p>
    <p>Lilies is designed to be extremely simple and portable. With a small set of kernel, clear semantics, and a powerful macro system, Lilies makes it easy to combine expressions into higher-level constructs.</p>
    <p>The language is designed to be extensible and flexible: its hygienic macro system lets users defines new syntax and corresponding semantics safely. A set of built-in special forms and macros is provided to simplify common programming tasks; these act as syntactic sugar over the core language.</p>
    <p>Lilies aims to be efficient practical and safe. With a strong type system, an ownership model forces memory safety and, and compile-time evaluation capabilities, the language can force programmers to write efficient and safe code. Lilies can express complex algorithms and data structures in functional, imperative, declarative and message passing styles or so.</p>
    <p>The standard library for Lilies are divided into two parts: a core language library that provides basic data types, syntaxes, and contracts; and a compile-time library that supplies macros and compile-time functions.</p>
    <p>The language Lilies should be implemented with both an interpreter and a compiler. Together with REPL, Development Environment, Debugger, and other tools to provide a complete programming experience.</p>
    <p>The language has a full type system: primitive types, composite types, generic types, and user-defined types, plus type annotations and type inference. The type system should support type inference, type checking, and type casting. Providing with interface, trait, and generic programming capabilities.</p>
    <p>Lilies should include a complete module system (module definition, import / export, and versioning) that support dependency management and module resolution.</p>
    <p>It should also include a complete exception handling system (exception definition, exception throwing and catching, and exception propagation) with custom exception types definition and hierarchies.</p>
    <p>The language should support continuation system (definition, capture and invocation), including continuation system should support first-class continuations and continuation passing style.</p>
    <p>Finally, Lilies should provide a comprehensive metaprogramming system (macros, compile-time functions, and code generation) that support hygienic macros and compile-time evaluation.</p>
    <p>Lilies（全称 “List Interpret Language in s-Expression Syntax”）是一种列表处理语言方言。本报告描述了 Lilies 语言的设计与实现。</p>
    <p>Lilies 的设计目标是极其简单且可移植。通过一个精简的内核、清晰的语义以及强大的宏系统，Lilies 能够方便地将表达式组合成更高层次的构造。该语言强调可扩展性与灵活性：其卫生宏（hygienic macro）系统使用户可以安全地向语言中添加新的语法及相应语义。语言提供了一组内建的特殊形式和宏以简化常见编程任务，这些可视为语法糖。</p>
    <p>Lilies 追求高效、实用与安全。借助强类型系统、强制内存安全的所有权模型以及编译时求值能力，语言能够帮助程序员编写高效且安全的代码。Lilies 可用于以函数式、命令式或消息传递等风格表达复杂算法与数据结构。</p>
    <p>Lilies 的标准库分为两类：一类是核心语言库，提供基本数据类型、语法与契约；另一类是编译时库，提供宏和编译时函数。</p>
    <p>Lilies 应当同时实现解释器和编译器，并配套提供 REPL、开发环境、调试器及其它工具，以提供完整的开发体验。</p>
    <p>该语言应具备完整的类型系统，包括基本类型、复合类型、泛型类型和用户自定义类型，并支持类型注解与类型推断。类型系统应支持类型推断、类型检查与类型转换，并提供接口、特征（trait）和泛型编程能力。</p>
    <p>Lilies 应设计完整的模块系统，包含模块定义、导入导出与版本管理，模块系统应支持依赖管理与模块解析。语言还应设计完整的异常处理系统，包含异常定义、抛出与捕获以及异常传播，并支持自定义异常类型与异常层次结构。</p>
    <p>Lilies 应设计完整的续体/延续（continuation）系统，包含续体的定义、捕获与调用，支持一等续体和续体传递风格（continuation-passing style）。</p>
    <p>最后，Lilies 应设计完善的元编程系统，包含宏、编译时函数与代码生成，元编程系统应支持卫生宏与编译时求值。</p>

 Introduction 引言</summary>
      <p>A generic programming language cannot satisfy all the needs of all programmers. Thus reduce the complexity of the language is important. Keeping the least core language and giving users the ability to extend the language.</p>
    <p>A simple and clear expression syntax and the unlimited combinability of expressions can thus construct a practical and effective programming language.</p>
    <p>Lilies have many design from earlier Lisps and Scheme dialects. First-class functions(procedures), lexical scope, continuations, macros. Syntax are also a objects that can be manipulated programmatically. But in contrast to them, Lilies is designed to be with a strong static type system.</p>
    <p>Lilies meant to be a native language competed with c. Or be like a compile target, so that other languages can be implemented upon it. In D-Flat system, Marguerite is implemented upon Lilies.</p>
    <p>Every symbols in Lilies sharing same namespace, no matter they are variables, functions, classes, interfaces, modules or so. In each expression, operators and operands are distinguished by their position.</p>
    <p>Though other lisp dialects use function application to archive loop, Lilies provides full functional loop constructs as built-in syntax extension other than core language. The tail call optimization is also provided to make sure loops are efficient.</p>
    <p>Classes for the object-oriented programming paradigm are provided. Everything in Lilies is an object, including functions, classes, interfaces, modules, and so on. Classes can be computed at compile-time, allowing for powerful metaprogramming capabilities and generic programming. Lilies supports monomorphized generics, allowing for efficient code generation and type safety. With traits and interfaces, Lilies supports polymorphism and code reuse. With contracts, Lilies supports design by contract programming. There also provided with full compile-time type checking and type inference capabilities.</p>
    <p>Modules in Lilies are first-class citizens. Modules can be defined, imported, and exported.</p>
    <p>The language is able to capture every continuation, which is "rest of the computation" at any point in the program. For which advanced control flow constructs can be built upon. When a continuation is captured, it will be saved as "escape procedure", a function that can be invoked later to resume the computation from the point where the continuation was captured. Markable, there exists a special kind of continuation, "delimited continuation", which will also be supported in Lilies.</p>
    <p>For a higher-level logical, algebraic effects can be also handled with Lilies. The effect handlers can be implemented with continuations, but in Lilies, it will be treated as a separate construct to provide better syntax and semantics.</p>
    <p>A full functional exception handling system is provided. With conditional system, exceptions can be defined, raise, caught, and propagated. Allowing users to resume from exceptions or handle them in a flexible way. For non-local control flow, a simpler and lighter exceptions system can be used to implement coroutines, generators, and other advanced control flow constructs.</p>
    <p>There are various ways to extend the language. Macros are the most powerful one. Macros in Lilies are hygienic and provide user with the ability to parse AST, fetch or drop context information, and generate new syntax trees. Thus new syntax constructed can be hygienic or unhygienic as needed. Syntax objects are first-class in Lilies, provides the ability to parse, manipulate, and generate syntax trees, especially in macros. The other way to extend the language is through symbol generation. It is possible to generate new expressions with given symbols or attributes at compile-time (likely Ksp for kotlin or Roslyn for c#).</p>
    <p>Macros system for Lilies must ensure that macros used in the program can provide same information as built-in syntax at compile-time. So that the compiler can provide full error information for user.</p>
    <p>The language is built with attribute grammar. So that every syntax can be associated with attributes, which can be used to store type information, scope information, or other metadata.</p>
    <p>Everything except <span style="display: inline-block;">

</span> family are used to create new bindings through closure capture. Thus, the language is designed to be referentially transparent. Everything including variables, functions, classes, modules, and macros should be defined before use.</p>
    <p>Those features make Lilies a powerful tool for building complex software systems. Furthermore, a research for computer program theory.</p>

 Background 背景</summary>
      <p>The lilies language is designed and implemented as part of the D-Flat system. For creating a practical programming language and a powerful tool that can be used to implement other languages.</p>
    <p>In the design of Lilies, many ideas and concepts from other programming languages are borrowed.</p>

 Guiding Principle 指导方略</summary>
      <p>The design of Lilies is guided by several principles:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Simplicity: The language should be simple and easy to learn, with a small set of core constructs and clear semantics.</li>
      <li>Portability: The language should be portable, able to run on a variety of platforms and architectures.</li>
      <li>Extensibility: The language should be extensible, allowing users to define new syntax and without modifying the core language.</li>
      <li>Orthogonality: The language should be orthogonal, with constructs that can be combined in a variety of ways without unexpected interactions.</li>
      <li>Uniformity: The language should be uniform, with consistent syntax and semantics across different constructs; Source code should be able to be treated as data and vice versa.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For real world programming, the following principles are also important:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Enable library creation and code reuse.</li>
      <li>Provide strong type system to catch errors at compile-time.</li>
      <li>Allowing for efficient code generation and execution.</li>
      <li>Support multiple programming paradigms, including functional, imperative, and declarative programming styles.</li>
    </ol>

 Variable, Slots & Fields 变量, 插槽与字段</summary>
      <p>Variables in Lilies are some space allocated to store values.</p>
    <p>Slots are locations within objects that can hold values, named or not. In practice, slots are some space allocated within an object to store values.</p>
    <p>Fields are similar to slots, but they are named and is used to store values that are associated with a specific object instance.</p>

 Type System 类型系统</summary>
      <p>Every value in Lilies has a type. Types are used to classify values and determine what operations can be performed on them.</p>
    <p>It is able to define new types by combining existing types (structures) or inductively defining new types (recursive types).</p>
    <p>Each type are individual, defined by its name, structure, and behavior. But types can also have hierarchical relationships with other types through inheritance and subtyping. A type can be a subtype of another type, if and only if it inherits from that type and implement all traits and interfaces defined the type implemented.</p>
    <p>Supertype doesn't means that all values of the subtype can be treated as values of the supertype. The only guarantee is that when a constraint requires a value of the supertype, a value of the subtype can be used instead.</p>
    <p>Every type must derive a default "empty" value, together with its corresponding type, which is used when a value of that type is required but not provided. Every type has its own type checking rules, which are used to determine whether a value is of that type or not. Thus empty values can be distinguished from other values of the same type.</p>

      <p>Ignore type is a special type that indicates that a value should be ignored. Values of Ignore type are not stored or used in any way. Ignore type is often used in situations where a value is required by the syntax or semantics of the language, but the value itself is not important. Ignore type has only one value, also a variable, which is also called Ignore.</p>
    <p>In practice, Ignore type is used to indicate that a value should be ignored or discarded.</p>
